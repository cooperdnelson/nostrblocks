# nostrBLOCKS
**Overview**
This project aims to create a comprehensive repository of modular, plug-and-play microservices. These microservices, or "nostrblocks" can be easily referenced and utilized by agents when building applications, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development process.

**Goals**
- Modularity: Each microservice is designed to be independent and easily integrated into various applications.
- Reusability: Microservices can be reused across multiple projects, reducing redundancy and development time.
- Compatibility: Aligns with the Bitcoin Design Guide philosophy, ensuring a cohesive and user-centric approach to microservice design and implementation.
- Interoperability: Built with the Nohr protocol in mind, enabling secure, decentralized coordination and communication between agents and services**.

**Features**
- Plug-and-Play: Microservices can be easily plugged into existing architectures with minimal configuration.
- Scalable: Designed to handle various scales of applications, from small projects to enterprise-level solutions.
- Consistent Design Philosophy: Follows the Bitcoin Design Guide principles to maintain a uniform user experience and high-quality standards.
- Decentralized Coordination: Supports future integration with the Nohr protocol for agent-driven orchestration and service management.

**Getting Started**
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/cooperdnelson/microservices-repo.git
2.	Install Dependencies:
Each microservice has its own README with setup instructions.
3. Deploy or Integrate:
Choose the microservices that fit your project and integrate them as needed.

**About Nostr**
Nostr is an open protocol for decentralized message transmission, with the intention to be able to resist internet censorship while maintaining session integrity. 
The protocol achieves decentralization through users publishing content associated with a cryptographic public key to various "relays", which are WebSocket servers that store and distribute an activity stream of received data from users. 
This allows the network to verify users and achieve account portability on Nostr, as users have to sign all posts using their secret key, preventing any relay from tampering with content without invalidating the signature.
